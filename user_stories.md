# User Stories for Bus Mall

## overall Goal
As an online retailer, I want to do market analysis on proposed products so that our bus-riding consumers are accurately targetted to match their preferred products.

## Marketing research team
 
I want to display three separate images of products for the user to choose from and select their favorite. 

I want at least 20 product images to be compared without duplicating any image that was immediately displayed in the grouping before. 

i want the user to click through the products 25 times. 

Data results should include how many times each product/image was clicked in addition to how often it was shown. 

for clear understanding of the data,the final results should be placed in a readable format.
