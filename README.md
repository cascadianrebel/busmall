# Bus Mall app
Bus Mall is a catalog that wants to do market research on 25 products. The research can be conducted by comparing the products to the other products as a user selects their preference.

To get clear results, the final tallies will appear in a chart below the selection. 

## acknowledgements 
This project could not have been completed without borrowing naming conventions from Rhiannon Mortensen (specifically, "uPencils" for the writing/eating utensils. It was too perfect of a name)

Additionally thanks go toward Jason and Max for helping debug my code.
